# Memory_game__project
The Memory Game is a fun and simple two-player game that tests brain memory. In this game, a set of cards is laid face down. Players take turns flipping two cards to find matching pairs. If the two cards match, they remain face up. If not, they are flipped back down. The game continues until all pairs are found.  We build a Memory Game in Java.
